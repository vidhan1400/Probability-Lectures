# Probability-Lectures
This repository contains lecture notes of a course called 'probability and random processes' covered by one of the most cited mathematics professors at IITB, Dr. Pillai.
These are gold standard for everyone who wants to strengthen their grasp on Markov processes.
I donot own these lectures. They are uploaded for the sole purpose of learning.
