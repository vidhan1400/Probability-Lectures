# Probability-Lectures
This repository contains lecture notes of a course called 'probability and random processes' covered by one of the top mathematics Professors of IITB, Dr. Pillai.
These are gold standard for everyone who wants to strengthen his grasp on Markov processes.
I donot own these lectures, they are uploaded for the purpose of learning.
